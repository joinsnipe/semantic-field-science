# Organization
- Name: Semantic Field Science (SFS)
- Author: Rubén Abella
- Domain: semanticfieldscience.org
- Founded: 2024
- Location: Global (origin: Spain)

# Core Framework
- Name: Modelo del Campo Semántico Humano (MCSH) / Human Semantic Field Model
- Type: Foundational conceptual framework
- Purpose: Observing, measuring, and formalizing semantic divergence — the distance between what a system says it is and what it structurally is.
- Core Equation: D(t) = |S(t) − R(t)| where S(t) = narrative signal, R(t) = structural reality, D(t) = semantic divergence
- Key Concepts: Semantic field, Semantic dynamics, Semantic time, Narrative tension, Semantic authority, Human–AI interaction

# Products & Applications

## Systemic Fragility Observatory
- URL: https://www.semanticfieldscience.org/observatory
- Status: LIVE (February 2026)
- Description: Real-time monitor of global systemic fragility. Applies the MCSH to systemic risk using Markov chain models (7 states), Monte Carlo simulation (n=10,000), and 10 non-conventional indicators. Public access, no registration required.
- Key Feature: Critical window May 2026 projection

## SPE Audit
- URL: https://speaudit.com
- Status: Active (Patent pending)
- Description: Forensic integrity engine that certifies the temporal integrity of any file — AI outputs, corporate documents, contracts, compliance records — through cryptographic Forensic Capsules. One-click integrity certification for any enterprise. Designed for regulators, auditors, and enterprises in regulated environments.
- Technology: Ed25519 cryptographic signing, timestamped integrity proofs

## SPE Trace
- URL: https://spetrace.com
- Status: Active (Patent pending)
- Description: Measures the semantic distance between what an organization says it is and what the market understands it to be. S(t) vs R(t). Semantic reality measurement for any organization.
